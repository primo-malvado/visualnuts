In this project we will find a library that creates a integer ran, and for each number prints to the console:

- 'Visual Nuts' : if the number is a multile of 3 and 5;
- 'Visual' : if the number is a multile of 3 an not a multiple of 5;
- 'Nuts' : if the number is a multile of 5 an not a multiple of 3;
- the number itself: if none of the above conditions are true.
